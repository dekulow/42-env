# 42-env [ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸](#) | [ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·](README.fr.md)
**A faithful replication of the 42 school development environment within a container.**

*42-env provides a standardized development environment that matches the 42 Paris school setup, ensuring consistency across different host machines.*


## Requirements

- Docker installed on your system
- VS Code with Dev Containers extension (for VS Code integration)
- [XQuartz](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/xquartz#default) (for macOS/Apple Silicon users running GUI applications)

## Setup Options

### Option 1: VS Code Dev Container

The simplest way to use 42-env is through VS Code's Dev Containers feature:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:shiftwavedev/42-env.git
   ```

2. Copy the .devcontainer directory to your project:
   ```bash
   cp -r 42-env/.devcontainer /path/to/your_project/
   ```

3. Open your project in VS Code
   
4. When prompted, select "Reopen in Container" or use the Command Palette (F1 or âŒ˜â‡§P on Mac):
   - Type "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"

VS Code will build the container and open your project with all the 42 environment tools and settings ready to use.

For projects requiring MLX or other graphical applications:

1. Install XQuartz on your host system (if using macOS):
   ```bash
   brew install --cask xquartz
   ```

2. Before starting your VS Code session, open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   xhost +localhost
   ```

3. In `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, ensure these settings are present:
   ```json
   "containerEnv": {
     "DISPLAY": "host.docker.internal:0"
   }
   ```

4. When you're done your session, you can restore security settings with:
   ```bash
   xhost -localhost
   ```

### Option 2: Terminal/Command Line

If you prefer working in a terminal:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:shiftwavedev/42-env.git
   ```

2. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t 42-env 42-env/.devcontainer/
   ```

3. Run a container with your project mounted:
   ```bash
   docker run -ti -v /path/to/your_project:/app 42-env
   ```

   All 42 tools (gcc, norminette, etc.) are available in your PATH.

To use MLX or other graphical applications from a terminal-launched container:

1. Install XQuartz on your host system (if using macOS):
   ```bash
   brew install --cask xquartz
   ```

2. Before starting your container, open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   xhost +localhost
   ```

3. Launch the container with the DISPLAY environment variable:
   ```bash
   docker run -ti -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0 -v /path/to/your_project:/app 42-env
   ```

4. When you're done, you can restore security settings with:
   ```bash
   xhost -localhost
   ```
